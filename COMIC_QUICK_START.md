## 🚀 Getting Started (3 Easy Steps)

### Step 1: Write Your Story
Create a diary entry as usual. For best results:
- Write at least 50-100 words
- Include a clear beginning, middle, and end
- Describe events, feelings, or experiences
- Be descriptive (helps the AI create better visuals)

**Example Entry:**
```
Today I finally worked up the courage to talk to Sarah at the coffee shop. 
My heart was racing as I walked up to her table. She smiled when she saw me, 
and we ended up talking for two hours about our favorite books. I can't 
believe how easy it was to talk to her. When I left, I felt like I was 
walking on air. Maybe I'll ask her out next time.
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Writing for Comics:
1. **Be Visual**: Describe what you saw, not just what you thought
2. **Include Action**: Comics work best with movement and events
3. **Show Emotion**: Describe facial expressions and body language
4. **Set the Scene**: Mention locations, time of day, weather
5. **Have a Story Arc**: Beginning → Challenge → Resolution

### Example Transformations:

❌ **Bad for Comics:**
```
I felt sad today. Work was boring. I came home and watched TV.
```

✅ **Good for Comics:**
```
The rain matched my mood as I trudged through the office doors. My boss's 
stern face appeared over my cubicle wall, criticizing my report. By lunch, 
I was ready to quit. But then Sarah from accounting shared her homemade 
cookies and told me about her similar struggles. Her kindness reminded me 
why I keep going. I left work with a small smile, rain or no rain.
```
